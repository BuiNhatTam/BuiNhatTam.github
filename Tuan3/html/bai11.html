            Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for<br> describing the look and formatting of a document written in a <br> markup language. Although most often used to change the style of <br> web pages and user interfaces written
            in HTML and XHTML, <br> the language can be applied to any kind of XML document, including plain XML,<br> SVG and XUL. Along with HTML and JavaScript, CSS is a cornerstone technology used by most websites to create visually engaging webpages,<br>            user interfaces for web applications, and user interfaces for many mobile applications.[1]<br>

            CSS is designed primarily to enable the separation of document content from document presentation,<br> including elements such as the layout, colors, and fonts.[2] <br> This separation can improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility
            and
            <br> control in the specification of presentation characteristics, enable multiple HTML pages to share<br>
